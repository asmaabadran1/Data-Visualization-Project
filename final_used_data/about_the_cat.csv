Breed,Description
Ocicat Cat,"Despite its wild appearance, the Ocicat is one hundred percent domestic, so it’s ideal for those who long for a cat with exotic looks and a tame, friendly personality. Named for its remarkable resemblance to the ocelot, the Ocicat has a short coat that’s easy to care for, and its temperament is so gregarious that it’s often referred to as a dog in a cat’s body.
The Ocicat gets its cheerful, outgoing personality from the breeds that formed its foundation, namely Siamese and Abyssinian. This fantastic cat is capable of walking on a leash, playing fetch, and learning tricks and commands that are typically associated with dogs rather than cats.
This fun-loving cat seeks good times above all other things and will happily follow its people wherever they go. Nowhere is off limits: Many Ocicats love water and enjoy following their human friends at shower or bath time, poking curious paws into the water to make sure that everything is as it should be! Ocicat owners with koi ponds and aquariums must often go to great lengths to cat-proof or risk having their finned friends become targets for fishing.
Like Orientals and other breeds descended from Siamese, Ocicats long for human attention and can become despondent if they are ignored or neglected. Families who must spend lots of time away at work and school find that their Ocicats tend to regain their cheerful nature when they have another pet to play with. These cats typically get along well with other friendly felines and they’re equally capable of forming lifelong bonds with well-behaved dogs.
Ocicats have a reputation for greeting visitors and getting on well with entire families. At the same time, they have a tendency to choose a favorite person.
Similar to other breeds with Siamese heritage, Ocicats can be quite vocal. They love to chat back and forth with their favorite people and the more you talk to them, the more they’ll “talk” back to you!"
Exotic Shorthair Cat,"The adorable, personable Exotic Shorthair cat is a cross between the Persian and the American Shorthair. Friendly toward newcomers and affectionate toward family members, these cats adore their people and enjoy nothing quite so much as the attention of their human companions. They are fond of cuddling – so much so, that it's not at all uncommon for them to climb under the covers with their favorite person.
Exotic Shorthair cats are famous for following their family members around the house. If you are sitting in one room and their toys are in another, they may bring a favorite toy into the room where you are and play with it next to your feet.
Speaking of playfulness, Exotic Shorthair cats do enjoy playtime, but they typically play in a gentler, slower manner than the average cat. If you live in a small apartment and don't have room for a huge cat tree, this might be the ideal breed for you!"
Javanese Cat,"Sometimes referred to as the Colorpoint Longhair, the Javanese cat is affectionately nicknamed the ""Javi."" Just like the Siamese cats that make up the breed’s foundation, this kitty is friendly, playful, and talkative, often meowing and chatting for reasons their human companions might not understand. Javanese cats are outstanding family pets overall. Their ability to get on well with others including other felines and well-behaved dogs makes them a lot of fun to be around.
The Javanese cat is extremely athletic, with a fondness for high jumps, fast-paced laps around the house, and interactive games. These cats are also excellent mousers, so any rodents that cross their paths aren't likely to survive for long.
In their quest for fun and entertainment, Javanese cats have a tendency to poke their noses into everything, quickly learning how to open cupboards and drawers. Like many other social cat breeds that thrive on human interaction, Javanese cats can become depressed if their favorite people spend more time away than they do at home. For this reason, these cats are best for families that define themselves as homebodies."
Bombay Cat,"Stunning looks and an intriguing personality make the Bombay cat a charming addition to any household. These medium-sized shorthair cats are absolutely gorgeous thanks to their pure black coats and their brilliant copper-colored eyes.
Similar to the Burmese cats that make up the breed's foundation, Bombays tend to be chatty. At the same time though, they are less vocal and far less demanding than their Burmese cousins – probably due to the calming influence of the American and British shorthair cats that make up the other half of the Bombay hybrid.
As family pets go, Bombay cats are outstanding. Rather than bonding with a single individual, they are affectionate toward everyone they know – and they have a tendency to get along well with other pets."
Bengal Cat,"With exotic looks to match its name, the Bengal cat originated as a cross between the Asian leopard cat and a domesticated cat. Often, Bengal cats have at least a little bit of Egyptian Mau in their background. These days, most members of the Bengal cat breed are the product of a cross between two purebred Bengal cats.
Playful and active, Bengal cats are excellent pets. Quite a bit less standoffish then some other wildcat hybrids, these incredible felines enjoy affection and develop close bonds with their family members. Even though they can be very friendly, don't mistake Bengal cats for couch potatoes: They’re anything but docile – once they've met their sleep quota, they are ready for action!
Bengal cats love to climb and like their wild, jungle dwelling cousins, they seek high vantage points from which to view their domain. They are curious too – they like to be in the middle of everything and they enjoy learning how things work.
Bengal cats are notorious for opening doors, activating light switches, flushing toilets, emptying cupboards, and more. They are eager to learn tricks, and thanks to their high level of intelligence, they’re very easy to train. Try ""Sit,"" ""Shake paw,"" and games like fetch."
American Bobtail Cat,"The American bobtail cat is renowned for its friendly, almost doglike personality as well as its wild appearance. This incredible cat does have wild ancestors, but it's behavior is purely domesticated.
American bobtail cats are highly intelligent, with a reputation for being talkative. They are known to develop wide vocabularies that include a variety of meows, chirps, and purrs.
Despite the American bobtail's wild ancestry, members of the breed are known to develop strong bonds with their human families. In addition, they have a reputation for getting along very well with other pets.
American bobtails aren't just outgoing: they are also incredibly active, with an appreciation for jumping, climbing, and exciting games. These cats are highly trainable, too Favorite activities include playing fetch and walking on leashes with their family members.

Chantilly / Tiffany Cat,"Sometimes called the Tiffany cat and sometimes referred to as the Chantilly cat, this unique breed has a soft, silky, semi long-haired coat and a sweet, friendly personality.
Registered Chantilly Tiffany cats are quite rare, but many medium-to-long haired domestic cats share similar characteristics in terms of personality and appearance.
Should you be fortunate enough to bring one of these kitties into your family, they’ll provide you with comforting companionship and delightfully playful antics."
Asian Semi-Longhair Cat,"Also known as the Tiffanie or Tiffany cat, the Asian semi-longhair cat is a fairly new breed that was developed in the 1980s.
A lucky accident led to a gorgeous new feline with a soft, silky coat in a medium length. Not only are these cats beautiful, they are playful, curious, and friendly. Much like the Asian cats they were developed from, these kitties have a tendency to vocalize loudly and make their opinions known. They are loving and devoted to their families and they are known to display jealousy toward other pets who get in the way or demand affection.
Asian semi-longhair cats are playful and curious. They are not above stealing small objects that attract their attention, so pet parents should keep a close watch on important personal items!"
Chausie Cat,"If the Chausie cat reminds you of an extra-large Abyssinian, you're on the right track! These incredible felines were developed by crossing jungle cats – also known as swamp cats or reed cats – from Southeast Asia with domesticated Abyssinians.
Weighing in at up to 30 pounds, Chausies are among the largest domesticated cats in existence. As a hybrid, every Chausie cat is a unique individual, with a big personality to matChausie it's size. Chausie cats develop strong bonds with their families and do not like to be left alone."
Birman Cat,"Also known as the sacred cat of Burma, the Birman cat is a large, long-haired breed with a heavy bone structure. Most of these cats exceed 12 pounds once they reach adulthood. Birman cats tend to be quiet, a bit shy with strangers, and they can be somewhat reserved even with people they know well. They have a tendency to attach themselves to a single person, so if you're someone who's looking for a loyal cat that loves you above all others, the Birman might be for you! Birman cats have soft, silky fur in a creamy, pale eggshell color. Darker points similar to the markings on a Siamese are present, along with white “mitts” or snowshoe feet. Stunning blue eyes are another unique feature of the Birman cat breed."
American Polydactyl Cat,"Also known as Hemingway cats in honor of the cats that roam Ernest Hemingway's estate in Florida, most American polydactyl cats are born with at least one extra toe on each front foot. Some polydactyl cats have extra toes on their hind feet as well. A select few have extra toes only on their hind feet and not on their front feet.
Even though the American polydactyl cat is not officially recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association of America, and even though it is not a specific breed of cat, it is adored for its cute, whimsical appearance. The extra toes on a polydactyl cat's front paws lends to the illusion that the cat is wearing mittens or perhaps that it has opposable thumbs. Some polydactyl cats have so many extra toes that their paws are double the size of an average cat's paws.
Some cat fancier clubs recognize all cats with extra toes. They are shown under the general name “American polydactyl cat.” This sometimes leads to confusion, causing newcomers to think that American polydactyl cats are a distinct breed.
The reality is that polydactyl cats can be of any breed, and they can be of any color. The only thing that makes a polydactyl cat stand out from others is the presence of those extra toes, which are caused by a genetic mutation."
Burmilla Cat,"With lovely personalities to match their stunning good looks, Burmilla cats offer the very best of the Burmese and Chinchilla Persian breeds.
Burmilla cats are renowned for their laid-back temperament. The breed is family-friendly, with a reputation for getting on well with children and other pets. Cats and well-behaved dogs will find a steadfast friend in the Burmilla.
These gorgeous kitties are playful but not hyperactive. They are quiet and not overly demanding, yet they thrive with plenty of attention from their families."
Abyssinian Cat,"With its lean, elegant profile, the Abyssinian cat bears a close resemblance to ancient Egyptian cat statues. Rich, coats in exotic shades of gold and cinnamon combine with large, expressive eyes, lending a sense of mystery to the breed's appearance.
Normally outgoing and active, with a fondness for being the center of attention, the Abyssinian cat develops a close bond with its family. Even so, this breed has a shy side to its personality. Abyssinian cats are often quick to disappear when strangers arrive!"
Colorpoint Shorthair Cat,"The Colorpoint Shorthair cat might remind you of a Siamese – and for good reason! Essentially, Colorpoint Shorthair cats are Siamese of different colors. They share a similar background and history with the only difference being their unique colors. While Siamese cats come in just four distinct hues, there are 16 different Colorpoint Shorthair cat colors to choose from.
Just like their Siamese cousins, Colorpoint Shorthair cats have lean, athletic bodies and outgoing personalities. Their sparkling blue eyes brim with intelligence, and they are notoriously chatty."
Turkish Van Cat,"Gorgeous kitties with cashmere soft coats, Turkish Van cats are renowned for their fun-loving personalities and their often quirky behaviors.
If you're thinking about bringing a Turkish Van cat into your family, be sure that you have plans for keeping this intellectual kitty entertained. These cats don't do well when left alone for long periods of time; however, they do get along very well with other animals and can form strong bonds with dogs as well as with their fellow felines.
While Turkish Van cats can be child-friendly when kids behave appropriately, they do have boundaries. They prefer fun, active interactions rather than too much holding and cuddling, and they will not tolerate hair pulling or any other form of mishandling. Despite having a slight aversion to too much handling, they sometimes choose to relax on a favorite person's lap for some well-earned TV time, and they like to sleep near people they trust.
Anyone who longs for an ultra-friendly cat that loves nothing more than spending time together will probably enjoy life with a Turkish Van. These kitties happily follow their people throughout the house, waiting for an opportunity to help with everything from paperwork to washing dishes.
Since these cats like water, their families often have feline company in the bathroom. If you want to make a Turkish Van cat happy, just leave a faucet running at a slow dribble. Those mesmerizing drips will almost certainly keep them entertained!
Speaking of entertainment, these cats are outstanding jumpers and they really don't like to spend much time on the floor. They absolutely require a tall cat condo and they truly appreciate window seats. Without high, suitable perches, they will make their own space on your tabletop, desk, or china cabinet, perhaps knocking important items to the floor in the process."
Thai / Old Style Siamese Cat,"Thai Old-Style Siamese cats – sometimes simply referred to as Thai cats – are charming companions with beautiful features and playful, inquisitive personalities. Just like their western Siamese cousins, these kitties love everyone, including kids, other cats, and cat-friendly dogs. In fact, they’re so affectionate and social, they hate to spend time on their own.
Intelligent and curious, Thai cats are capable of learning tricks, particularly when rewards are on offer. Whether you’d like your cat to come when you call their name or use another signal, or if you’d like to enjoy rousing games of fetch, the Thai cat will be glad to oblige.
If you bring a Thai cat into your family, you’ll want to do everything you can to prevent boredom. These kitties need companionship and acceptable activities, or they’ll find their own fun, reaching into cupboards, opening drawers and investigating their contents, and perhaps learning how to open doors and turn on faucets. Thanks to their determined personalities, there’s little a Thai cat can’t learn! Channel their behavior into puzzle toys and give them another cat for a friend, and you’ll find that life is a bit less colorful.
Despite bouts of mischievous behavior that’s sure to put a smile on your face even when your cat is splashing in your bath or trying to help you clean up after dinner, Thai Old Style Siamese are capable of deep relaxation. When you settle in for a movie or snuggle into bed at night, they like to cuddle close, purring the entire time.
Talkative and truly endearing, with big personalities that are difficult to resist, Thai cats make astonishing pets for families with time and attention to share."
Ragamuffin Cat,"If you're looking for a big, friendly, long-haired cat, the Ragamuffin might be the perfect breed for your family. These kitties are very much like Ragdoll Cats; in fact, they are directly descended from that breed and share quite a few similar traits.
Ragamuffin cats make fast friends with everyone they meet, so long as they are treated with respect. Unlike many cats that prefer to be left to their own devices, these kitties love to be held and will relax completely when picked up and snuggled. They enjoy easy-going pursuits such as watching your favorite shows and movies, napping alongside you while you work from home, and snuggling up with you at night.
Despite their tendency to spend lots of time relaxing, Ragamuffin cats do have a playful side. They will happily play on their own, batting a favorite ball or a catnip mouse from here to there. They appreciate interactive games and their families love their adorable, delicate demeanor, which comes out even when they are attacking a toy.
Because their thick, luxurious coats are prone to picking up debris and because their personalities are so relaxed, these cats are best suited to indoor life. Even though they might be able to withstand cold temperatures, they simply aren't meant to brave the elements or face hazardous situations."
Toyger Cat,"In spite of its wild sounding name and exotic looks that lend the appearance of a toy tiger, the Toyger cat is 100% domestic. These kitties love their families, easily bonding with people of all ages. Not only do they love humans, they easily form friendships with other animals.
While Toyger cats are friendly and outgoing, they don't mind being left on their own so long as their humans are gone for only a short while. If you're someone who spends more time away than you are able to spend at home, this might not be the right breed for you. Of course if you're open to having two cats, they'll keep each other entertained and welcome you each time you return."
Scottish Fold Cat,"With just one look at the adorable Scottish Fold cat, it’s easy to see how this breed got its name! Not only are these kitties cute beyond compare, the breed is a family friendly one. Scottish Fold cats get along well with kids and other pets including friendly felines and well behaved dogs.
Gentle and playful, Scottish Fold cats are less rambunctious than many other breeds. They are happy to spend time simply enjoying your company, and they're likely to follow you throughout the house as you complete your daily routine.
If you're someone who is looking for a cat that likes to converse, consider a Scottish Fold. With far quieter voices then many other vocal breeds including the Siamese, these cats can develop quite an interesting vocabulary, which still use to express themselves and chat to you about everything from the level of food in their dish to the fact that it's time for you to wake up in the morning. Talk to a Scottish Fold, and you can expect quite a bit of chatter in return.
If you are hoping to bring a Scottish Fold kitten into your family, be prepared to spend a little bit of time on a waiting list. These kitties are very popular, yet they can be difficult to find. The good news is, Scottish Fold cats are such incredible companions, they are well worth the wait.
Scottish Fold cats enjoy company and dislike being left alone. Luckily, these kitties are perfectly happy with companionship from another animal on those days when you need to work or spend several hours per day away from home for another reason,. When you return, you can count on a happy greeting."
American Shorthair Cat,"Friendly, personable, and easy to care for, the American Shorthair cat shares many things in common with the domestic shorthair. The main difference is that American Shorthair cats always share common characteristics with one another, while domestic shorthair cats display various trades from the breeds in their backgrounds.
This can cause some confusion as the American Shorthair was originally named the Domestic Shorthair. The truth is, American Shorthair cats are a breed of their own!"
Kurilian Bobtail Cat,"With a thick, luxurious coat that's often beautifully marked to resemble a wildcat's fur, the Kurilian Bobtail cat is renowned for having a sweet, gentle nature. Like the breed's name suggests, Kurilian Bobtail cats have short to ultra-short bobtails. Kurilians have one of a kind tails. Sometimes compared with a snowflake or a fingerprint, no tail is identical to another.
Big, active, and intelligent, the Kurilian Bobtail cat has an intense play drive and a natural love for hunting. This breed is renowned for its fishing skill as well, so families with aquariums and tiny pets such as hamsters and guinea pigs will want to ensure that these vulnerable animals are kept far from the Kurilian Bobtail, which views all small creatures as prey to be captured.
Kurilian Bobtail cats typically get along very well with other cats, dogs, and children. They love to play, and anyone who is willing to spend time engaged in rousing games will automatically get this cat's undivided attention.
Despite its hunting prowess and high activity level, the Kurilian Bobtail cat loves to snuggle with its favorite person. These cats do have a tendency to choose a preferred companion, and they are also known to give other family members the cold shoulder when it's time to choose a lap for TV time or settle in at bedtime."
Himalayan Cat,"Is the Himalayan a Persian cat? Is the Colorpoint Persian the same as a Himalayan? The answer depends which registry the cat belongs to! Some organizations view the Himalayan – fondly nicknamed the ""Himmie"" – as a Persian variant rather than a separate breed. Others classify  the Himalayan cat as a breed of its own.
Himalayan Colorpoint Persian cats have pointed markings and gorgeous blue eyes like Siamese cats. At the same time, they possess long, silky coats like their Persian cousins. In addition, that Persian influence means Himalayan Colorpoint Persians typically have flat or shortened faces that contribute to their unique appearance.
Most Himalayan cats are incredibly sweet natured, with a fondness for cuddling up to their favorite people. Thanks to their Siamese heritage, these kitties tend to be a bit more playful than the average Persian. If you are looking for a cat that loves to lounge and you don't mind daily grooming sessions, then the Himalayan / Colorpoint Persian might be your perfect feline companion!"
Pixie-Bob Cat,"With a short tail and a wild appearance, the Pixie-Bob cat is certain to captivate your imagination while simultaneously capturing your heart. Even though these cats appear exotic, they are now 100% domestic: DNA testing has shown that contemporary Pixie-Bob cats have no wild bobcat blood.
Pixie-Bob cats are extremely friendly and sweet natured, with a fondness for all family members including kids, other cats, and well-behaved dogs. Speaking of dogs, many families who count Pixie-Bob cats as members compare them to canines in terms of personality. These kitties are loyal to a fault, and some of their favorite games are similar to the ones dogs enjoy. For example, Pixie-Bob cats love to play fetch, they enjoy walking on leashes once they learn how, and unlike most cats, they have a tendency to appreciate the opportunity to ride in the car alongside their family members.
If you're looking for a big, playful cat with an unusual appearance and an outstanding personality, the Pixie-Bob may be the companion you've been searching for."
Russian Blue Cat,"Also known as the Archangel Blue or Archangel Cat, the Russian Blue is a stunning feline, not to mention a marvelous companion. With soft, silky, short coats in various shades of silvery blue-gray, these kitties happily accompany their family members around the house, but are prone to hiding away when strangers visit.
The Russian Blue isn't much of a mischief maker. It's true that these cats will get into things during their kitten years, but once you've gently taught them which surfaces are theirs to sit on and which should be left alone, they'll generally stick to approved areas.
This isn't all they are capable of learning: Russian Blue cats are highly intelligent and will easily learn to open doors, play fetch, come when called, and more. This capability does not place them in the doglike cat category though; because they can be skittish and shy, Russian Blue cats do not typically take to leash training. They are far happier sticking to known quantities and spending time with their families.
If you bring a Russian Blue into your home, you'll have a steadfast companion with a fondness for daily routines and gentle cuddles, along with a fairly strong opinion about everything that takes place in the household. While their families are away at work, these kitties will happily nap instead of looking for ways to entertain themselves. They do learn to get along with other pets and they can appreciate respectful children, but they don't need constant companionship.
Beautiful, fairly self-sufficient, and friendly with people they've come to trust, Russian Blues make well-rounded pets and fit easily into a variety of living situations."
Japanese Bobtail Cat,"Playful, intelligent, and with an attitude that’s only a little demanding, the Japanese Bobtail cat is a rare breed with stunning looks, soft silky fur, and a melodious singsong voice.
If you're lucky enough to bring a Japanese Bobtail cat into your home, you'll have a friend for life. These cats are exceptionally loyal and loving, even though they believe that you live to serve them. They love to follow their favorite people around, meowing and tapping for attention, and bringing toys to ask for games of fetch that can seem to go on forever.
Japanese Bobtail cats are renowned for their friendliness. Many are so outgoing that they will even greet strangers like old friends. They love to be involved in everything, reading the same books you do, playing computer games and surfing the Internet together, and helping you with all of your projects, carrying on a conversation the entire time.
The breed's friendly nature doesn't just extend to humans: These cats typically enjoy the company of other felines and they will readily make friends with dogs as well.
Most depictions of the Japanese Bobtail cat show the Mi-Ke color variants, which is pronounced 'mee kay."" Mi-Ke is a unique tricolor pattern that is normally displayed by female cats. This is atrait that is shared with calico cats, which also display three colors in their coats.
Even though Mi-Ke (calico) is the best-known Japanese Bobtail cat color, these kitties can be of any shade and pattern including solid colors, van, tabby, and bi-color. Whatever your favorite cat color, it's likely that there's a Japanese Bobtail to match!"
British Shorthair Cat,"Once known as the British Blue and exclusively bred for blue-gray coloring, the British Shorthair cat now comes in a multitude of colors, but it retains its typical rounded profile and it's delightful – yet somewhat reserved – personality.
In a nutshell, British Shorthair cats are pedigreed versions of British domestic shorthair cats that have been selectively bred over time to create a distinctive appearance and predictable personality traits.
These cats love their families and enjoy staying close, but they aren't big on cuddling. They prefer to lounge next to you rather than occupying your lap, and they aren't terribly demanding or overly vocal. British Shorthair cats make excellent pets for most households, but they don't tolerate disrespect, and they don't like to be held or carried.
These traits don’t add up to a mean or antisocial personality; instead, they’re an indicator that the British Shorthair may not be ideal for families with young children who aren't yet able to understand boundaries."
Balinese Cat,The Ojos Azules cat breed standard was eliminated when breeding was suspended. The last known TICA breed standard for Ojos Azules cats was dated 2004; no other registry provides a standard.
Cornish Rex Cat,"With their soft, curly coats and slim, elegant frames, Cornish Rex cats are completely different from other breeds. These delightful felines require a little bit of special care to keep their velvety fur in tip-top shape; in return, they offer their owners an abundance of affection. Cornish Rex cats are playful and active, with extroverted personalities.
They love to be in the middle of everything, and they have a tendency to make friends with everyone they encounter. If you're looking for a lap cat, you're in luck! The Cornish Rex loves to cuddle – partly because their short, downy coat simply doesn't hold much heat and partly because the breed is exceptionally sociable."
Sphynx Cat,"If you’re looking for a friendly cat with a big personality, the Sphynx might be ideal. Bonus points if you’re hoping for a pet that doesn’t shed, as these hairless cats are either completely hairless or are covered in the barest layer of fine, velvety down.
With bold features and an intense gaze, the Sphynx may not appear to be the friendliest cat on the planet, but don’t let this kitty’s looks deceive you! The Sphynx is a gregarious, personable cat with lots of love to share with everyone, including strangers and other pets. Quick to greet their family members at the door and just as fast to hop under the covers when bedtime arrives, Sphynx cats take every possible opportunity to socialize.
Without adequate companionship, the Sphynx quickly becomes despondent, bored, and destructive. These kitties absolutely hate to be left alone, and while they’re spending time with you, they have a tendency to offer unsolicited help and advice. Loud meows can give way to unrelenting wails if you try to confine a Sphynx to its own space, making these cats unsuitable for families that don’t want a high level of involvement from their pet.
Last but not least, Sphynx cats need to be kept warm and protected from the elements. These cats can’t live outdoors where they’ll suffer from sunburn and windburn, and even inside, they look for the warmest possible place to rest. Offer a heated cat bed, and you’ll know exactly where to find your Sphynx when it’s time to play."
Burmese Cat,"Burmese cats are accomplished conversationalists in sleek, soft packages. These gorgeous kitties are direct descendants of Siamese cats, which explains their chatty nature; however, their voices are softer and less demanding.
Just like their cousins, Burmese cats are playful, energetic, and highly intelligent. They're extremely sociable and they love to snuggle. In fact, these kitties are so affectionate that the National Alliance of Burmese Breeders (NABB) has nicknamed them the ""ultimate companion cats.""
There are two types of Burmese cats: American and European. The American Burmese is stockier, with a broader head, a shorter muzzle, and distinct rounded eyes. The European version, also called the British Burmese, has a long muzzle, a wedge-shaped head, and eyes that are distinctly slanted."
German Rex Cat,"If you've been searching for a highly intelligent cat, the German Rex might be the perfect breed for you. These cats are so smart that they've been nicknamed the ""Einsteins of the cat world."" This trait makes the German Rex a lot of fun to live with: This kitty takes very well to training, easily picking up new tricks and amusing family members with innovative antics.
Because German Rex cats are so intelligent, they require plenty of toys. Puzzle games are favorites, and they thrive with lots of interactive play using everything from bits of crumpled paper to feathered wands. Without adequate stimulation, these kitties can get into quite a bit of trouble, poking their noses into cabinets and showing you what gravity is all about by knocking cherished decorative objects off high shelves.
Some of the world's smartest cats can be a bit standoffish. Luckily, the German Rex is as affectionate as it is intellectual. These kitties live for attention from their favorite humans and they enjoy cuddling when they're not busy playing. They get along well with everyone in the family, including other cats and well- behaved dogs."
Turkish Vankedisi Cat,"Stunning white cats with silky coats, Turkish Vankedisi cats offer more than just great looks: These kitties are friendly and personable, but not quite so clingy as some other breeds such as the Oriental Shorthair.
Turkish Vankedisi cats are incredibly intelligent. They are fond of attention and one of their favorite ways to get it is by encouraging their human friends to play. Don't be surprised if your kitty presents you with a favorite toy in hopes of getting you involved in a game of fetch!
Turkish Vankedisi cats have a tendency to pick a single family member as their favorite, however they are likely to make friends with everyone in the house, including other pets.
Although these kitties look as if they'd rather not muss up their coats, they are athletes at heart. Turkish Vankedisi cats are renowned for their jumping and climbing abilities, and they are exceptional hunters when given the opportunity. In addition, there one of the few breeds that takes very well to leash training. If you've ever wanted to walk your cat through the neighborhood, a Turkish Vankedisi will be happy to accompany you."
European Shorthair Cat,"A friendly, fun-loving feline that's a favorite with families throughout Europe and beyond, the European Shorthair cat is accurately described as the pedigreed version of Europe's domestic shorthair cats.
These cats are extremely docile, with a reputation for making friends with children and other pets including well-behaved dogs and non-dominant cats. It is worth noting that European Shorthair cats are individuals with a wide range of personality traits. They have a reputation for being somewhat territorial, so families with multiple cats should place an even stronger emphasis on finding a cat with a compatible personality when choosing a housemate for the cats already in their homes.
Although they are playful, European Shorthair cats are equally fond of sleep. If you bring one of these kitties into your home, rest assured that you'll find them napping cozily anywhere they can make themselves comfortable. Often, they will make their way onto a human companion's warm lap for an extended lounge session. Thanks to their cuddly nature, European Shorthair cats are perfect for anyone who enjoys opportunities to relax with a furry friend."
California Spangled Cat Cat,"Fondly referred to as the house leopard, the California Spangled cat has a friendly, outgoing personality that is in direct contrast to its wild appearance.

Serengeti Cat,"Despite its exotic-sounding name, the Serengeti Cat is 100% domestic. These beautiful, playful cats were developed by crossing Bengal cats with Oriental Shorthairs. If you've been on the fence about which breed is your favorite, the Serengeti might be ideal for you as it brings so many positive traits together.
As you might expect, this long-legged kitty is an exceptional athlete that thrives in an atmosphere where activities such as jumping and climbing are supported. The Serengeti cat's ideal family provides plenty of high perches that allow for a great view of everything that's happening, and they understand the importance of keeping important items out of reach. These curious cats do not make a distinction between their toys and your keepsakes, so be sure to keep those collectibles secured. Like the Oriental Shorthair, the Serengeti Cat has nimble toes that are perfect for opening cupboards and drawers. Childproof locks might thwart their efforts at inspecting cabinet interiors, however these kitties are highly intelligent and can sometimes find their way into places that surprise their families.
Besides having the ability to get into everything, Serengeti cats can learn how to turn on faucets, sometimes making it necessary to swap lever style handles for knobs. Luckily, these kitties are capable of learning more desirable tricks. If you ever wanted to play fetch with a cat, the Serengeti might be your ideal companion.
Speaking of companionship, Serengetis do not like to be left alone. These cats thrive on attention, whether it's from their human family members, other cats, or friendly dogs. They do take some time to warm up to new people and new animals, but once they make friends, they're wonderfully loyal and exceptionally chatty."
Selkirk Rex Cat,"Nicknamed “The cat in sheep's clothing,” the Selkirk Rex is an adorable, woolly-haired feline with a unique personality. With a bit of an independent streak, this might not the best breed for someone who's looking for a traditional lap cat; even so, the Selkirk Rex generally has a calm demeanor and does enjoy human companionship.
Friendly and inquisitive, these cats enjoy napping and once they've completed their kitten years, they have a good reputation for keeping out of trouble. At the same time, they exhibit a wonderfully playful side, and will happily entertain you with their silly antics.
Despite their disdain for long cuddling sessions, Selkirk Rex cats don't like to be left alone for long periods of time. They prefer to spend their time in the company of others, whether snuggling up to watch TV with their human companions or napping alongside another cat.
It’s well worth mentioning that not all members of the Selkirk Rex breed have the same personality traits. Some breeders have outcrossed with Persians, Exotics, British Shorthairs, and American Shorthairs, resulting in cats with adorable curly coats and extremely docile personalities."
Snowshoe Cat,"Adorable white feet give the Snowshoe cat its name, and distinctive white markings in the shape of an upside down “V” adorn its muzzle. Cuteness isn't the only thing that makes the Snowshoe such a wonderful cat: This breed absolutely loves people. In fact, Snowshoes are among the friendliest cats! While they do have a tendency to choose one person as their absolute favorite, they like everyone and readily make friends with new people shortly after being introduced.
Expect lots of fun and games if you bring a Snowshoe cat into your family. These kitties are curious and playful, and they like nothing quite so much as spending plenty of quality time with their favorite people. They'll help you with all sorts of tasks from typing to cleaning and when it's time to cook dinner or wash dishes, they happily provide advice from a nearby vantage point - perhaps a high place like the top of the refrigerator.
Snowshoe cats are expert cuddlers, too. If you have room on your lap, they'll take advantage of the opportunity to curl up for a movie or a bit of reading. At bedtime, they're likely to stretch out beside you, perhaps sliding under the covers or sharing your pillow.
Just like other breeds with lots of Siamese in their background, the Snowshoe cat requires lots of attention and becomes terribly unhappy if left alone for long periods of time. If boredom sets in, these kitties may develop unwanted behaviors and vocalize loudly. Fortunately, Snowshoe cats get along very well with other felines. If your family can't always be around, a second cat can help prevent loneliness and the destructive habits that can come with it.
Thanks to their outgoing, agreeable personalities, Snowshoe cats can be a great fit for any family with lots of love and attention to give."
Dragon Li Cat,"Also known as the Chinese Li Hua and nickname to the Chinese Fox Flower cat, the Dragon Li cat is an ancient purebred with a distinct wild appearance. Just like their wild ancestors, these cats are known for their independence and intelligence. At the same time, they are loyal to their families, with a playful streak a mile wide.
If you bring a Dragon Li cat into your family, you will be rewarded with plenty of fun and games. Unfortunately for those who prefer lap cats, this particular breed isn't at all fond of snuggling. In fact, these cats can become anxious when they aren't given time and space to themselves.
Dragon Li cats appreciate the outdoors and are outstanding hunters. They are at their happiest when allowed access to safely enclosed outdoor spaces such as catios, and when they are taught to walk on a leash from a young age.
It’s very important to note that these unique felines do not enjoy small, confining indoor spaces. While most cats are perfectly happy to share an apartment with an attentive human family, the Dragon Li cat needs a big house with lots of room to roam if it is kept completely indoors. Clearly, this cat requires special circumstances and isn't the best breed for everyone."
Oriental Longhair Cat,"An outgoing, friendly personality plus a silky, luxurious coat: These are just two things that make the Oriental Longhair Cat stand out! These lovely - and loving - cats share so many traits with their Oriental Shorthair cousins and other Oriental cat: They’re playful, intelligent, and far more social than the average feline, with a built-in need for attention.
Bring an Oriental Longhair cat into your home, and you’ll have a friend for life. These cats love nothing quite so much as to follow their favorite person’s every move, poking curious noses into everything from the refrigerator to the bathtub, and reaching out to tap with a paw whenever anything looks out of place.
Not only do Oriental Longhairs use body language to express themselves, they have the ability to develop an impressive vocabulary of meows, trills, and chirps in keeping with their Siamese heritage. These gregarious cats are opinionated and they love to engage in conversation.
When it comes to companionship, the Oriental Longhair cat has some special needs. These cats don’t do well at all when they’re left alone for too long; in fact, they can become seriously distressed or develop destructive habits if they’re deprived of the ability to socialize.
While they do tend to choose a favorite human to follow and snuggle with, they’re happy making friends with other family members including those with four legs and fur. Another social cat or a friendly dog makes the ideal companion for an Oriental Longhair, particularly if you’re someone who spends quite a bit of time away from home.
As cats go, Oriental Longhairs are certainly more affectionate than most. If your family wants at least one fantastic cuddle buddy, this breed is more than capable of lending a paw."
Singapura Cat,"If you've ever found yourself wishing for a tiny cat, the Singapura might be ideal. These adorable kitties stay small throughout adulthood, weighing an average of just four to eight pounds. With quiet voices to match their small stature, Singapura cats have large ears and wide eyes that add even more charm to their kitten-like appearance.
At first glance, the Singapura has a somewhat delicate look; but underneath that soft, silky coat, you'll find stout muscles that give this cat impressive athletic ability. Speaking of looks, Singapura cats have an exotic appearance, with beautiful cheetah lines on their faces and unique ticked coats in a soft sepia tone. Lighter cream-colored fur provides contrast along the belly, chest, muzzle, and chin.
Singapura cats have beautiful personalities, too. While not terribly mischievous, these kitties are curious, playful, and intelligent, capable of learning tricks, and able to get along well with other pets including cats and well-behaved dogs. They're also known for their ability to make friends with newcomers faster than the average cat.
As if all these wonderful traits weren’t enough, these adorable kitties take every opportunity to snuggle. Once naptime has come to an end, they enjoy following their favorite person around the house, sometimes offering advice in a tiny, melodic voice. Like other people-oriented cats, Singapuras don't like to spend too much time alone. Luckily, any form of company – human or animal – helps prevent boredom and the destructive behaviors that can sometimes result. With plenty of attention and lots of love, the Singapura makes a charming companion for life."
Munchkin Cat,"The Munchkin cat is so much more than an adorable little pet: These cats are sweet natured, personable, and playful. With extra short legs that contribute to the breed's nickname ""Dachshund of the cat world,"" these kitties tend to be on the small side. They may have short or long hair, and they come in every color imaginable.
Thanks to the bouncy, short strides they take when running, Munchkin cats are often compared to rabbits and ferrets. The truth is, they are 100% feline, with magnetic personalities, a strong play drive, and an intense love of cuddling.
As you might have guessed, this breed is named after the Munchkins from The Wizard of Oz. Their short legs are caused by a naturally occurring genetic mutation that is caused by an autosomal dominant gene. Munchkin cat breeders select for this gene, which affects leg bone length. These kitties don't know that their legs are far shorter than the average cat's; they simply enjoy life a little closer to the ground! To get a better view, they’ll often stand on their hind legs.
Munchkin cats come in three different heights: Standard, supershort, and rug hugger. Leg length affects the height only; the rest of the cat's body is proportioned like that of an average domestic cat.
You might think that Munchkin cats can't jump. While it is true that their leaps are not as impressive as those of average sized cats, many individuals can make it from the floor to the seat of the couch or the top of your bed with ease. Since they aren't likely to leap onto tall tabletops and high display shelves, members of the Munchkin cat breed might be ideal for people who love cats but worry about the impact they might have on collectibles.
One thing is certain: Bring a Munchkin into your home, and you'll instantly fall in love with their adorable looks and charming personalities."
American Longhair Cat,"The American longhair is not a specific cat breed, although aficionados are encouraging cat fancy associations to recognize this unique feline. For now, the term American longhair is used to indicate a cross between a Persian cat and an American shorthair cat.
American longhair cats are typically medium-sized, reflecting the size and weight of their parents. Their coats come in a variety of colors and patterns and in varying degrees of thickness. There is sometimes confusion concerning the American longhair cat vs the Maine coon cat. This stems from the description of the Maine coon as America's original longhair cat."
Oregon Rex Cat,"The Oregon Rex cat was a fairly playful, friendly cat with headstrong ways and a tendency to bond with its family members. These cats did not like to be alone, which is a trait that they shared with other Rex cats, Orientals, and Siamese.
Unfortunately, the Oregon Rex cat breed is no longer produced, meaning that for all intents and purposes, Oregon Rex cats are extinct. The closest relatives of the Oregon Rex are Selkirk Rex cats, which originate in Montana rather than Oregon."
American Wirehair Cat,"A soft heart and a sweet personality hide behind the rough exterior of the American wirehair cat. These friendly felines are versatile and robust, with a unique appearance that their families appreciate. American wirehair cats are technically a shorthaired cat breed; however, the structure of their hairs gives them the appearance of a medium haired breed.
The American wirehair cat's coat might contain some straight hairs, but most of the hairs that make up this unique cat's coat have a crimped texture with a hooked end. It's coat has a unique springy feel and sheds moderately, about the same as other shorthair cat breeds.
American wirehair cats come in a wide range of colors and patterns. Breeders out cross them to American shorthairs to ensure genetic diversity."
Korat Cat,"Stunning blue-gray fur is only the beginning: The Korat cat is considered to be a living good luck charm in it's native Thailand. Whether you're in search of good fortune or if you're simply hoping to grace your home with a loving, intelligent cat, the Korat may be the perfect pet! This is among the rarest of all cat breeds, so you’ll certainly count yourself fortunate when you find the perfect Korat kitten to spoil.
Korat cats are closely related to Siamese, and share some of their cousin's most endearing personality traits. These kitties love attention, and they enjoy being involved in every aspect of household management: Whether you're fixing lunch, cleaning up after dinner, folding laundry, or catching up on your favorite show, the Korat cat will be on hand to offer advice and a helping paw.
A little less chatty than the Siamese, the Korat might greet you a chirping meow or give you an insistent tap when you aren't offering quite enough attention.
Playful and friendly, Korat cats tend to get along well with everyone including kids, other cats, and well behaved dogs. Fun and games make this cat's world go round, and the more you interact, the happier your relationship will be. Once playtime is over, the Korat cat will eagerly snuggle up next to you."
Chartreux Cat,"Exquisite blue coats, intelligent personalities, and smiling faces make the Chartreux stand out. This old French cat breed was nearly wiped out during the first and second world wars and remains rare today.
Chartreux cats bond with their families but tend to prefer one individual over everyone else. They have a tendency to follow their favorite person from room to room, sometimes mewing or chirping softly. If you're looking for a cat with a reputation for quiet vocalizations, the Chartreux may be ideal; in fact, some Chartreux cats are mute."
Minuet (Napoleon) Cat,"The Minuet cat, formerly known as the Napoleon cat, is a dwarf cat breed created by crossing Munchkin cats with Persian cats, Himalayan cats, and Exotic Shorthairs. The Minuet’s short legs come from the Munchkin. The Persian breed group contributed the Minuet’s abundant coat and rounded head, eyes, and ears.
When the breed was first being developed, it was called the Napoleon cat, named for Napoleon Bonaparte, the short-statured French general with a notoriously big personality. However, the The International Cat Association (TICA) voted to change the breed name to Minuet in 2015, just before the breed achieved full championship status.
Minuet cats inherited a mix of wonderful traits from the parent breeds the were used in the breed’s development. They are gentle and sweet like the Persian, but can also active and curious like the Munchkin. Minuets are very friendly, loving, and become very bonded with their people. They enjoy cuddles and get along well with people and other pets.
The Minuet comes in short-haired and long-haired versions; both have an abundant and dense coat, which may be any color or pattern. The breed has a semi-cobby, well-rounded body and very short legs. Though the body is medium sized, adult Minuets weigh just 7 to 8 pounds.
Some Minuet kittens have the gene for short legs and others do not. Minuets with long legs are referred to as “nonstandard.” These Minuets have all the same wonderful attributes as standard Minuets, but they have long legs like a regular cat. Nonstandard Minuets cannot compete in cat shows—these kittens are sold to pet homes. For this reason, a nonstandard Minuet kitten might cost a bit less than a standard Minuet kitten.
Although Minuets can’t climb up quite as high as cats with long legs, they can get around easily. They can run surprisingly fast, especially when they get a case of the zoomies, and their low-to-the-ground body is agile, taking turns with ease. If your Minuet has trouble jumping or climbing onto the couch or your bed, you can provide pet stairs or a pet ramp to make it easier for them."
Ussuri Cat,"Ussuri cats are rare indeed - in fact, this unusual cat is among the rarest breeds on the planet. They’re very difficult to find, even in Russia.
In the unlikely event that you’re able to bring one of these cats into your home, plan ahead! These are not lap cats by any stretch of the imagination; in fact, they have a very strong prey drive and their instinctual need to hunt makes them poor candidates for life as a pet in a small, confined home. A large catio or a safe outdoor run might help ease the stress of confinement when free roaming isn’t possible.
These wild-looking cats do have the ability to develop strong bonds with humans, typically choosing a single person to lavish with affection.
Expect some surprises if one of these kitties makes its way into your family: When allowed to hunt, Ussuri cats present their favorite humans with a share of whatever they have caught."
Somali Cat,"Can’t decide between an Abyssinian and a long-haired breed? The Somali cat offers the best of both worlds, with exquisitely soft ticked coats, striking facial markings, and all the personality that makes the Abyssinian such a popular breed.
Also known as long-haired Abbysinians, Somali cats make loving companions. Normally fond of their people, these adorable kitties are sometimes aloof with newcomers, but quickly form new friendships.
If you bring a Somali cat into your family, be prepared for fun and games! These cats are curious, alert, and a bit mischievous. They like to watch people and wait for opportunities to get involved in whatever is happening.
Open a cupboard, they’ll be right there, ready to poke their heads inside. Place clothing inside drawers, and they’ll soon find a way to help! Run a faucet, and the Somali cat might dab a paw in the water. After a while, these cats develop the ability to open drawers, doors, and cupboards on their own, and turn on taps for themselves, so they can play in the water without your help.
When it’s time to rest, the Somali will happily curl up in the nearest lap, perhaps kneading with paws and giving affectionate head butts. On chilly winter nights, they offer extra cuddle power, helping their families appreciate those silky-soft, cuddly coats even more."
Ragdoll Cat,"While some kitties dislike being held, the Ragdoll cat seems to live for cuddles. And while many cats are content to keep themselves entertained, Ragdolls actively seek the company of their favorite humans, following family members from one room to the next. These cats are not particularly nosy, but they do enjoy participating in daily life, often observing activities with happy, bemused expressions on their adorable faces.
If you are concerned about breakage that might happen after bringing an active cat into your family, the Ragdoll will gently put your fears to rest. These affectionate kitties prefer to be where you are, perhaps catching a favorite show on the couch or working on a project in the office or garage. Instead of breaking your collectibles, they're far more likely to offer reassuring purrs. These kitties are one of a handful of cat breeds that like water, so they're likely to follow you to the shower or sit on the edge of the bathtub, where they'll keep you company and perhaps get their paws wet.
Steadfast companionship isn't all you'll get from a Ragdoll: These gorgeous kitties live to make us happy, often repeating behaviors that elicit favorable responses from us. With positive reinforcement, it's possible to teach a Ragdoll cat certain tricks and behaviors.
If you are someone who likes cats and dogs but who can only bring a single pet into the family, the Ragdoll might be the ideal choice. After all, these cats have a well-earned reputation for displaying doglike behavior while offering the easy care that comes with choosing a cat as a family pet. Just in case you think you might miss walking a dog, rest easy: Ragdoll cats easily learn to walk on leashes and will happily accompany you through your neighborhood!
Speaking of dogs, Ragdolls get along with them just fine. These cats get along well with other felines, and they're capable of making friends with your entire family, including very young children."
Oriental Bicolor Cat,"An engaging personality plus an adorable appearance add up to none other than the Oriental Bicolour Cat!
These stunning kitties are almost identical to their Oriental Shorthair or Oriental Longhair cousins; in fact, many of these Orientals are also Oriental Bicolor cats. We’ll cut through the confusion in the breed history discussion but first, what can you expect if you bring an Oriental Bicolour into your family?
As it turns out, these fascinating felines have a whole lot more than mesmerizing good looks going for them! Their personalities tend toward the playful, curious side - and that’s probably due to heavy Siamese influence. These intelligent cats love to follow their family members around, getting involved in whatever’s happening at the moment. Like their close cousins, they are exceptionally chatty, chirping, warbling, and sometimes meowing loudly to emphasize a point!
Not only do Oriental Bicolor cats appreciate their human family members, they have a fondness for other felines and they even make friends with dogs. Where some breeds tend to be a bit standoffish with other pets, Oriental Bicolours like constant companionship and develop close relationships with other animals. These kitties like to have at least one friend nearby at all times and without enough attention from the people and animals they bond with, can develop serious depression.
Oriental Bicolors are a bit more demanding than many other cats, it’s true: But what they require in attention, they repay infinitely. Loving, attentive, fond of cuddling, and always happy to brighten even the gloomiest day, this kitty is one you’ll cherish for a lifetime."
Cheetoh Cat,"Large, exotic, and active, Cheetoh cats are fun-loving individuals that crave attention from their families. They tend to get on well with everyone – other pets included!
These incredible cats have a wild appearance, even though they are eight generations removed from the wildcats that make up the breed's foundation. Don’t let that fool you though: They are dedicated lap cats, happy to curl up on the couch and enjoy some well-deserved time in front of the TV!
Cheetoh cats can weigh more than 20 pounds. They are among the largest cat breeds ever developed, and as they’re relatively new, they are also among the rarest."
American Curl Cat,"The American curl cat gets its name from its ears, which curl backward, creating a unique shell-like shape. Just in case you're wondering whether this breed shares any genetics with the Scottish fold, the answer is no. Both breeds are distinct, with different characteristics.
Far more sociable than the average cat, these friendly felines like to greet their families at the door and follow them around the house. They like children and they have a tendency to get along well with other pets.
American curl cats come in every color and pattern imaginable, in both long and shorthair varieties. They have very little undercoat, and their topcoats tend to feel very soft and silky.
In addition to their signature ear shape, the American curl cat is known for having a long, luxurious tail.
As you might imagine, American curl cats with very curly ears are often reserved as show cats. Breeders tend to offer cats that have a less pronounced curve to their ear structure as pets."
Siamese Cat,"If you've been looking for a cat who likes to talk back, consider the Siamese. Among the most vocal of all breeds, these chatty cats love nothing more than to spend time alongside their favorite people, eagerly offering advice and opinions about everything that happens throughout the day.
Talkative tendencies are just the beginning. Siamese cats are friendly and playful, with the ability to get along well with just about everyone so long as they are properly socialized as kittens.
Charming blue eyes contribute to the breed's stunning appearance. Since looks aren't everything, it's important to note that the Siamese cat is highly intelligent and more than a little curious. These kitties keep their families amused with their antics and they are usually more than happy to learn simple tricks. Playing fetch is a favorite pastime, and outdoor walks on leashes are often enjoyed, as well.
Very busy families might do better with a cat that requires less attention, as the Siamese can quickly develop unwanted behaviors if left alone for too long. The good news is that if you have always wanted a Siamese kitten, having a second cat or a friendly dog that's willing to stand in as a playmate can be a remedy for the kind of boredom that can lead to destructive tendencies. This doesn't mean that you'll be able to leave your cat to its own devices; however, it helps to have another animal to provide companionship when you cannot be at your cat's beck and call.
Overall, Siamese cats are marvelous companions and fantastic snugglers. No wonder the Siamese is one of the world's most popular cat breeds!"
"Russian White, Black, and Tabby Cat","Three distinct coat colors in one adorable breed: Russian White, Black, and Tabby cats were all developed with help from the much-loved Russian Blue. Stunning looks, luxurious short-haired coats, and wonderful personalities are a few things that help these kitties stand out from the crowd.
Russian Black, White, and Tabby cats are playful and personable, but not terribly mischievous. Happy to keep their families entertained, these kitties make amusing companions thanks to their high intelligence. Like their blue-haired cousins, these cats quickly learn which behaviors earn pats and praise from their human family members, and which behaviors are best avoided. They share the Russian Blue’s sensitive nature; a loud scolding is likely to hurt this individual’s feelings and send them into hiding.
Friendly and sociable with family members including other pets including well-behaved dogs, Russian Tabby, White, and Black cats have a decidedly shy streak. They aren’t at all fond of strangers and will tuck themselves safely into a safe spot when new people come to visit. This trait means they aren’t good candidates for leash training; instead, it’s best to provide plenty of indoor exercise opportunities that allow for safe enjoyment on the cat’s terms.
Those who spend long hours away from home will be glad to hear that Russian White, Black, and Tabby cats are perfectly fine with the idea of keeping themselves entertained (or asleep) while their human friends are at work or school. They’re likely to greet you with a series of happy meows and a wiggling tail when you return.
Speaking of meows, these kitties are somewhat talkative, but far less so than their Siamese ancestors. They have a reputation for talking back when spoken to, and for reaching out with a questioning paw when they’d like to receive some attention. Some will “sing” to themselves while playing with a favorite toy, and some will become fairly demanding when they sense mealtime approaching.
If you’re lucky enough to make a Russian White, Black, or Tabby cat part of your family, you’ll enjoy a lifetime of companionship, cozy snuggles, and friendly chats."
LaPerm Cat,"A cute, curly coat is just the beginning: The LaPerm cat has an absolutely charming personality. Meet this sweet kitty just once, and you will fall in love!
As family pets, LaPerm cats adore everyone from tiny tots to grandparents. They also have a tendency to make friends with other pets including their fellow felines and well-mannered dogs. These kitties are fond of cuddling up, making themselves comfy whether on your lap, next to you, or underneath your covers.
Between naps, these fabulous felines stay busy. They are as fond of helping their people with projects as they are of playing with their toys. The LaPerm cat possesses quite an inquisitive nature, and will happily investigate unsecured cupboards and drawers, inspecting and sometimes removing their contents.
If you are hoping for a quiet pet, the LaPerm may be ideal. When this kitty does use its voice, the sound tends to be soft and melodious rather than harsh and demanding. To get your attention, the LaPerm cat is more likely to offer a soft tap with a paw.
These amazing cats are truly endearing, quickly making friends with everyone who crosses their path. If you socialize an LaPerm kitten well, it's quite likely that once grown, your cat will greet new acquaintances like old friends."
Siberian Cat,"Formally known as the Siberian Forest Cat, the Siberian is a medium-sized semi-long-haired breed with a stunning triple coat and a charming personality.
Intelligent and playful, the Siberian cat loves to give and receive affection. These adorable kitties live to spend their days and nights alongside their favorite people, often chatting in melodic voices that have nothing in common with the harsher vocalizations of other talkative breeds such as the Siamese.
Siberian cats have a great reputation for friendliness, even where strangers are concerned. These cats happily greet everyone and so long as their experience is a positive one, they have the ability to befriend very young children, other felines, and respectful dogs.
Even though they are friendly and playful, Siberian cats are not terribly mischievous. They will get into things on occasion, but they are far more interested in watching their favorite humans while providing little tidbits of advice via those chirping, trilling, meows that contribute to their lovability. Since they like water and have water resistant coats, Siberians have a comical habit of playing in the water and even joining their favorite people at shower time.
The Siberian cat does have a mellow side, but it may take some time for quiet behaviors to dominate as this breed doesn't reach full maturity until about five years of age.
Siberian cats aren't terribly clingy, but they do thrive with companionship as they are communal by nature. If you spend most of your time away from home, consider adopting a second cat to keep your Moscow Longhair company."
Aegean Cat,"The Aegean cat is one of the oldest natural domestic cat breeds in existence. By natural cat breed, we mean to say that this cat was developed without human input.
Aegeans are a relatively rare cat breed outside their native islands. Aegean cats typically have medium hair length, and are of medium size.
Aegean cats are friendly and intelligent. Over the millennia, they have developed a fondness for humans; in Greece and the surrounding islands, they are valued for their rodent catching skills, and are often treated to bits of food by fishermen and other residents. These cats make excellent family pets, as they like almost everyone.
Aegean cats are notably chatty – they have a tendency to enjoy long conversations with their people. Talk to an Aegean cat, and there likely to reply with happy chirps and meows."
Cymric Cat,"Sometimes referred to as a long-haired Manx cat, the Cymric (pronounced kim-rick) has a reputation for being friendly, affectionate, and highly intelligent.
While the Cymric cat is tailless as a result of a spontaneous genetic mutation, some individuals do exhibit very short tails. Completely tailless Cymric cats are nicknamed rumpys. Those with up to three tail vertebrae at the end of the spine are called rumpy risers, and those with more vertebrae that form a short, movable tail are called longys.
Besides their intriguing appearance, Cymric cats bring delightful personalities to their families homes. They have a reputation for being both playful and gentle, and they make excellent companions for people of all ages."
Australian Mist Cat,"The Australian Mist has the distinction of being the first pedigreed cat ever developed in Australia.
This stunning shorthair was created by crossing the Abyssinian with the Burmese. The Abyssinian contributed to the breed's lively personality and ticked coat; meanwhile, the Burmese lent its easy-going nature and softly shaded colors. Foundation cats included some domestic shorthairs, which contributed a wide range of genetics that ultimately led to the creation of a healthy cat breed that displays an incredible range of colors.
Australian Mist cats display lovely coats with an array of spotted and marbled tabby patterns. Ticked fur gives these cats a soft, shaded appearance, leading to the use of the descriptive word ""mist"" in the breed name.
Renowned as a loving, even-tempered cat, the Australian Mist is understandably popular in its nation of origin, and the breed is gaining even more popularity in show rings worldwide."
Peterbald Cat,"What do you get when you cross an Oriental shorthair with a Donskoy cat? A Peterbald cat! These whimsical creatures are easy to care for, with fun-loving, spirited personalities, and looks that can only be described as uniquely adorable.
The Peterbald cat has a sense of loyalty that many other felines simply don't possess: in fact, this cat is often compared to a dog simply because it is so affectionate toward its humans.
These cats are incredibly sociable, and will happily greet newcomers rather than hiding suspiciously when friends come to call. Because of their social nature, they are unhappy when left alone, meaning it's very important to provide constant companionship. The good news is that companionship doesn't have to be human: Peterbald cats are very similar to their Oriental cousins in that they can form close bonds with other felines and dogs.
Peterbald cats are playful and athletic. They spend their waking hours investigating everything, helping their favorite humans with chores, and looking for tall vantage points from which to survey their domain. They have a tendency to talk while they're at it, loudly expressing their opinions on everything from the amount of attention you're giving them to the fact that they require more food in their dish.
While the Peterbald cat might not be the ideal pet for everyone, this breed is a fascinating one. Those who are lucky enough to bring a Peterbald kitten home have a loyal friend for life!"
Nebelung Cat,"Also known as the long-haired Russian blue, the Nebelung cat is a relatively new breed as well as one of the rarest cat breeds in existence.
If you are lucky enough to bring a Nebelung cat into your home, you can expect a friendly, laid-back companion with stunning good looks to match an outstanding personality. This cat's silvery topcoat and pure blue undercoat lend a magical appearance that's much admired. This kitty is silky soft and while it is technically a long-haired breed, the coat is actually a medium length; longer than that of a shorthair cat but not near so long as that of a cat with very long hair, i.e. a Persian.
Nebelung cats are wonderfully affectionate, with lots of love to share with their families. They're fond of curling up for long naps and TV watching sessions, and given the chance, they'll cuddle up with her favorite people at bedtime.
The Nebelung cat is as playful as it is gentle. This breed is highly intelligent, and is easily taught how to play fun games like fetch. These kitties can learn how to walk on leashes, which allows for safe exploration of the outdoor world and provides some much-needed exercise.
While some breeds need constant attention from their people, the Nebelung cat is all right with a bit of alone time. This doesn't mean you can leave your cat unattended for days on end, but it does mean that your kitty will be okay entertaining itself while you're away at work. Of course, these cats get along well with kids and other pets, and they appreciate the opportunity to socialize whenever it arises, so long as socialization takes place within their family group.
Speaking of socialization, it's very important to introduce the Nebelung cat to a variety of situations, sounds, and people from a very young age. These kitties are prone to nervousness and require a bit more socialization than the average cat."
Egyptian Mau Cat,"Playful and curious when at home with family, the Egyptian Mau cat can be shy or even standoffish with strangers. These stunning cats are highly intelligent, with a reputation for making conversation with their favorite people.
Like most felines, these Egyptian beauties love to relax when the time comes, but for the most part, they are not couch potatoes! They truly enjoy playtime, and their ability to learn interactive games has given them a reputation for having almost doglike personalities.
If you bring an Egyptian Mau cat into your family, you will need to spend plenty of time helping to bring out the best in their personality. Be sure to focus on socialization to prevent problems at the vet and to ensure that the cat is comfortable with visitors; take care to ensure that all interactions are as positive as possible, so the cat learns that humans are fun and friendly, and that treats are involved when good behavior is put on display.
If you plan to show your Egyptian Mau cat, socialization takes on an even more important role: Aggressive cats are disqualified immediately and antisocial individuals aren't viewed as desirable even when their markings are beautiful."
Ukrainian Levkoy Cat,"Friendly, playful, and intelligent, the Ukrainian Levkoy also happens to be among the world's rarest cat breeds.
If you're fortunate enough to bring a Ukrainian Levkoy into your home, you can expect endless hours of cuddling, lots of vocal communication, and an endless display of silly antics that are certain to keep you entertained.
Ukrainian Levkoy cats require plenty of attention in return for their affection. These kitties really do not like to be left alone for long periods of time, and can become anxious and stressed without company. Luckily, another cat or a friendly dog will do in the event that you aren't able to spend most of your days at home.
These kitties are kid friendly, and they easily bond with every member of the family. They are often friendly toward strangers, serving as marvelous ambassadors for hairless cat breeds.
The Ukrainian Levkoy is highly inquisitive, with an uncanny ability to open cupboards and drawers. Even if you have no young children in your home, you might find yourself purchasing child-proofing latches."
Savannah Cat,"Gorgeous markings and fantastic personalities make Savannah cats pretty and popular. These incredible felines get their exotic appearance from the Serval, a small African wildcat with stunning spots, long legs, and massive ears. Their domestic parent (usually a Savannah cat that’s a few generations away from an F1 Serval / domestic hybrid) contributes all the wonderful personality traits that make domestic cats such desirable companions.
If there’s one thing you should know about the Savannah cat, it’s this: These kitties are typically very high-energy, even when they’re several generations along. They do love to settle in for snuggles but their play drive is incredible, and they are also wonderfully intelligent. This means lots of cat proofing is required; without it, your Savannah cat will happily explore every cupboard and drawer in your house, probably while removing various items for a thorough inspection.
Savannah cats can develop destructive behaviors if they’re allowed to become bored, so companionship, safe toys, and plenty of space are absolute essentials. Teach your cat to walk on a leash if you can; regular walks provide plenty of mental and physical stimulation - plus they give these friendly cats even more opportunities to socialize.
While most cats will go to great lengths to avoid water, Savannahs are the opposite. An aquarium soon becomes a coveted fishing spot, a koi pond presents an opportunity for swimming (and fishing) and your faucets quickly become favorite playthings. These cats quickly learn how plumbing works, and when given the chance, will hop up onto countertops to activate a stream of water for splashing. Open toilets are fair game, too.
Savannahs can be quite vocal at times, demanding food or attention as the need arises. Their vocabulary ranges from insistent meows to adorable chirps - and the odds are good that if you speak to them, they’ll carry on a conversation with you.
If you’re lucky enough to bring a Savannah cat into your family, prepare for daily adventures, and be ready to offer lots of love and patience as your kitty learns. Savannah kittens are quite a handful, and adults retain their need for ample activity throughout their lifetimes. We’d love to say that Savannah cats are fantastic for all families, but the truth is, this big, active cat comes with unique needs. Chat with the breeder or rescue you’re considering to make sure that you’re ready to be a Savannah’s cat parent."
Tonkinese Cat,"Can’t decide whether you prefer a Siamese or a Burmese? That’s where the “Tonk” or Tonkinese cat comes in! This adorable kitty offers the best of both breeds, thanks to its Siamese and Burmese heritage.
Tonkinese cats have fantastic personalities, but there’s a tradeoff for their love of human companionship: You can’t leave these kitties to their own devices for too long, too often, or they run the risk of developing separation anxiety. If you’re someone who spends a lot of time at work and you’re leaning heavily toward the Tonkinese, you can compromise by getting two cats instead of one. With a feline companion – perhaps a sibling – the Tonkinese has someone to talk to and spend time with, and there’s far less risk of unwanted behaviors. Plus, you get twice the love!
Tonkinese are nimble cats. Excellent climbers with a fondness for high places, they’re often found on top of refrigerators, tall cabinets, and other elevated spots. From there, they’ll often provide their human friends with unsolicited advice concerning everything from the amount of food in their dish to the evening’s entertainment. Leave the room, and they’re likely to follow you through the entire house, “helping” the entire time.
Just like Siamese and Burmese cats, Tonkinese love water. Leave a large, shallow pan of water on the floor for them to dabble in, perhaps with a few toys floating, and you’ll be able to catch a few moments to yourself – if you can tear yourself away from their adorable antics, that is!
Tonkinese cats might choose a single family member to lavish with attention, or they might share affection with everyone equally. One thing is certain: When it’s time to cuddle, these kitties are experts! Whether they’re lying in your lap while you read or watch TV, or if they’re lounging beside you in bed, you’ll appreciate their warmth, their soft coats, and their loving purrs."
Oriental Shorthair Cat,"If you love Siamese cats, then you'll probably adore Oriental Shorthair cats just as much! These amazing kitties are sized and shaped like their close cousins, but they display an incredible variety of colors and patterns.
Not only is The Oriental Shorthair a visually stunning cat, members of this breed tend to be exceptionally friendly and outgoing, with a fondness for nearly everyone they meet including other felines and even well-behaved dogs. The more friends, the better – in fact, while some breeds prefer solitary life, Oriental Shorthair cats enjoy living in groups!
These amazing kitties are well-suited to most families, but they do require lots of attention. Oriental Shorthair cats are highly social, and they can become depressed if left alone too often. The good news is that furry companions stave off loneliness in this breed just as well as human family members, so those who must often spend more time away at work than at home can enjoy sharing life with one of these delightful cats so long as there's a compatible pet in the home.
While Oriental Shorthair cats develop friendly feelings for multiple people, they have a tendency to choose a favorite person and spend most of their time in close contact."
Havana Brown Cat,"Friendly, intelligent, and playful, Havana Brown cats are excellent all-around companions for families of every kind. They are fond of children and their capable of forming lifelong bonds with other pets. All of these wonderful traits have earned the Havana Brown the nickname ""Chocolate Delight."" These kitties are absolutely exquisite, with gorgeous chocolate coats and vibrant green eyes. No other cat looks quite like a Havana Brown.
If you are hoping for an attentive pet, you might want to consider a Havana! These cats break through feline stereotypes that mention aloof, independent personalities; in fact, The Havana Brown is a charmer, thriving on human interaction. These kitties are not happy without their favorite humans by their sides."
Manx Cat,"The Manx is one of a few tailless cat breeds, yet it’s probably the best-known as it is more widespread than Kurilian Bobtail and Japanese Bobtail cats, which share some similarities. Depending on location and registry, these cats might have long or short hair in a variety of different colors - and it’s worth noting that some purebred cat registries refer to long-haired Manx cats as Cymric cats.
While the Manx cat breed standard requires show quality animals to be either tailless or nearly tailless, pet quality Manx cats may have slightly longer tails. In fact, there are a few nicknames for Manx cats with different tail lengths. “Rumpy” manx cats are completely tailless, while “rumpy risers” have small stubs. “Stumpy” manx cats have partial tails, and a manx with a nearly full length tail is called a ""Longy.""
Social and intelligent, members of the Manx family are often compared to dogs thanks to their high play drive and their tendency to develop strong bonds with their human friends and animal companions alike.
These cats are incredibly athletic, with powerful hind legs. Their ability to jump to great heights means that their families often find them peering down from the highest cupboard in the kitchen, or perhaps from the top of the refrigerator.
Not only do Manx cats enjoy high jumps, they have an intense sense of curiosity. Their agile paws easily jiggle open latches and the drawer pulls, enabling access to small areas filled with your most fascinating belongings.
If you bring a Manx into your life, don't be surprised if you find them following you to the shower, where they'll hide behind the curtain or door and reach in to catch droplets with their paws. Perhaps because of their island origins, Manx cats have a tendency to like water – unless, that is, you're attempting to bathe them!
Fantastic personalities make Manx cats outstanding companions for nearly any family - and adorable, unusual looks make them even more fun to spend time with."
Persian Cat,"A thick, luxurious coat is only the beginning! Persian cats bring joy to their families via loving personalities and gentle yet playful antics.
If you're looking for a cat that isn't into impressive displays of athleticism, the Persian might be the perfect breed for you. These cats love to lounge, particularly after they reach adulthood; perhaps that's why some people call them furniture with fur. Don't be fooled by this reputation, though; these cats do exhibit a playful streak, particularly when their people are interested in joining the fun.
Persians are not prone to excessive mischief; for example, they aren't into opening drawers and cupboards like their Oriental cousins are, and they are not normally into things like walking on leashes and playing fetch like some other breeds such as Siamese and Savannahs. They are however intelligent cats, capable of learning your routine, greeting you, and of course, curling up for snuggles as part of a daily routine.
Even though Persians are expert-level cuddlers, they are not terribly demanding. If you're looking for a cat who is happy to nap while you're gone and will cheerfully accompany you through your evening routine, you'll definitely want to give thePersian a second look.
Last but not least, despite having something of a froufrou reputation, Persians make excellent family pets. They have the ability to get along well with children, other felines, and even dogs."
British Longhair Cat,"Exquisite good looks, a charming personality, and luxurious silky, soft hair that comes in more than 300 different colors and patterns: These traits combine beautifully in the British Longhair cat. Meet one, and you'll be in love!
Quiet, adaptable, and friendly, these cats love their families but don't mind spending time alone. This is the perfect breed for cat lovers who long to share their lives with a kitty but don't have tons of time to spend together each day.
British Longhair cats get along well with nearly everyone, so long as boundaries are respected. These cats will choose when and how to receive affection: They don't appreciate being held tightly, and they often prefer to sit next to their humans rather than snuggling on a lap."
Sokoke Cat,"Also known as the Sokoke Forest cat or the African Shorthair, the Sokoke is an exotic-looking breed that originated in Eastern Kenya. A striking coat, a friendly personality, and a fondness for conversation makes this unique breed one to consider. If you’re looking for a cuddly, cozy companion, you might find the Sokoke cat a bit aloof. These cats do enjoy human companionship, but only on their terms. They have a marked distaste for being picked up and snuggled; instead, they prefer to follow their family members around, sometimes opting to rest alongside a favorite person during downtime.
Sokoke Forest cats are accomplished athletes, with a fondness for active pursuits. Cupboards and drawers don’t present much of an obstacle to the Sokoke, making cat-proofing well worth the effort. Since these cats like water, it’s important to secure aquariums well, too. Any small item can become a toy for this curious kitty, so it’s important to keep important objects secured or risk having them chewed and clawed into oblivion.
Speaking of claws, this cat isn’t afraid to lash out when threatened or disrespected. While Sokoke cats can make lifelong friends with kids, other felines, and respectful dogs, they are a touch less tolerant than most, making careful introductions even more important than usual.
Despite this kitty’s insistence on respect, most individuals love everyone and when well-socialized, will even greet strangers at the door. When family members return from a long day at work, the Sokoke is usually right there to say hello and have a chat about everything that happened during their human’s absence.
Because Sokoke cats originated in a warm climate and have low cold tolerance, these kitties do best with families that also appreciate warmth. They can develop tolerance for cool temperatures, but prefer to keep cozy. They are not well-suited to life outdoors."
Devon Rex Cat,"Petite size, pixie-like facial features, and an incredibly sociable personality make the Devon Rex cat a favorite. At the same time, this breed has a unique coat that makes it stand out from the rest: These adorable felines have soft, ultra-fine fur with a wavy texture - there’s nothing else quite like it.
If you've been looking for a low-shedding cat, the Devon Rex comes close. While there's no such thing as a fully hypoallergenic cat breed, Devon Rex cats have such fine, short hair and  shed so little that they leave barely a trace of themselves behind on furniture and clothing.
Elvin facial features including massive wide-set eyes and huge bat-like ears contribute to the Devon Rex cat’s signature appearance as well. Their personalities might be described as elvish too; these fun-loving cats are incredibly inquisitive, often following their family members around in an attempt to be involved in whatever is happening.
Sometimes described as part dog, part cat, and part monkey, these felines are accomplished climbers, and they’ll do whatever it takes to perch in the highest spot they can find - preferably one with a great view. They have an appreciation for tiny hiding places, too: Their owners might find them tucked behind the refrigerator, hiding under the sofa, or peering out from the insides of bookshelves.
Easily trained, they find a great deal of enjoyment in outdoor walks (leashed, of course!) and rousing games of fetch. When playtime comes to an end, the Devon Rex loves to settle down and enjoy affectionate cuddles. Not only do these kitties seek attention from their human family members, they also have a reputation for getting on well with other pets.
While Devon Rex cats are friendly toward everyone, it’s worth noting that they tend to choose a favorite person with whom to share most of their affection. As talkative as they are cuddly, they tend to converse in a series of chirps and trills rather than traditional meows."
Ojos Azules Cat,"In Spanish, Ojos Azules translates to ""blue eyes."" One look at the Ojos Azules cat, and you'll see exactly how this rare, beautiful breed got its name.
Because Ojos Azules cats are highly uncommon, you can count yourself extremely fortunate if you're able to bring one into your family. Not only are these cats exceptionally attractive, they are friendly, loyal, and playful. In short, The Ojos Azules is everything many people long for in a cat!
Ojos Azules cats like to snuggle and they thrive in an environment where they receive plenty of attention. These kitties don't like to be left alone for too long, and they appreciate their friends, whether those happen to be human family members or other pets. As you might've guessed, the Ojos Azules cat is capable of getting along very well with children, so long as they're respectful.
Temperament does play an important role when breeders select parents for an upcoming litter, so most offspring are friendly and personable, but there is an important caveat: as Ojos Azules cats must be carefully produced by outcrossing blue-eyed cats with those of other eye colors, the old saying that all cats are individuals is particularly true of this breed."
Brazilian Shorthair Cat,"Also known as Pelo Curto Brasileiro, the Brazilian Shorthair cat stands out as the first breed to originate in Brazil and gain international recognition.
These cats are quite large, but in contrast with the British Shorthair, they have an elongated look and long, slim legs. Friendly and outgoing, Brazilian Shorthair cats make outstanding family pets. They get along well with other cats, dogs and children."
York Chocolate Cat,"Also known as “Il Gatto Cioccolato,” the York Chocolate cat was a registered cat breed with deep brown, almost black fur. These kitties had luxurious fluffy coats thanks to their ancestors, who were primarily domestic long-haired cats of different breeds.
The York Chocolate cat was a friendly breed, happy to spend time with its people and fond of cuddling. These kitties were described as being playful, energetic, and intelligent, with a curious streak and an appreciation for being part of daily life. Mice didn't stand a chance in homes where your Chocolate cats were present as these beautiful felines also happened to be excellent hunters."
Maine Coon Cat,"Bold features, a thick, luxurious coat, and an incredibly friendly personality set the Maine Coon cat apart from the rest. These gorgeous kitties love to play, yet they enjoy taking time out for a well-earned nap when the mood strikes. Often, they’ll snuggle up next to their favorite people, which can be quite helpful on chilly evenings!
The Main Coon’s purr is warmly expressive, and it’s often loud enough to be heard from several feet away. Their vocalizations are surprisingly quiet for such big cats, but their vocabularies can be extensive, with a range of chirps and meows that help you understand exactly what they’re saying.
One of the largest cat breeds in existence today, and one of the most popular breeds worldwide, the Maine Coon has a heart to match its stature. These kitties tend to love people and get along well with other pets. They are ideal for families as they tend to have an appreciation for children. When you meet a Maine Coon cat, you'll understand why they are nicknamed the gentle giants of the cat world!"
Norwegian Forest Cat,"Striking looks and a warm personality help the Norwegian Forest Cat stand out from the crowd. This exquisite long-haired cat breed is an ancient one, with ample intelligence, fantastic social skills, and an appreciation for all of life's comforts.
Even though the Norwegian Forest Cat comes from a cold climate, these kitties love to keep warm. They appreciate an indoor lifestyle with plenty of soft, comfortable surfaces to accommodate frequent naps. They also have an appreciation for their families, but affection takes place on their terms rather than yours.
The Norwegian Forest Cat may very well decide to cuddle up in your lap or sleep on your pillow, but doesn't typically appreciate being picked up or held when it's not the cat's idea.
Despite the breed’s reputation for having quite an independent streak, Norwegian Forest Cats are loyal to their favorite people and are perfectly capable of making friends with other pets including well behaved dogs and other friendly felines.
If you see similarities between the Norwegian Forest Cat and the Maine Coon, you’re not imagining things!
The two breeds do have quite a bit in common including large stature, ultra-thick fur, and exceptional hunting prowess. It’s entirely possible that some of the cats that contributed to the Maine Coon (which, by the way is a natural breed) might have been Norwegian Forest Cats."
Turkish Angora Cat,"Also known as the Ankara cat, the Turkish Angora has a marvelous personality to match its stunning appearance. Highly intelligent, just a little bit talkative, and beloved for their tendency to develop complete devotion for their favorite person, these kitties like to be in the middle of everything, often watching the action without actually joining in.
Of course Angora cats do have a playful streak, curiously investigating cupboards, drawers, empty boxes, and everything else they can find their way into. They love games of chase, and can even learn to play fetch. The more you praise them and applaud their antics, the happier they'll be and the stronger your bond will become.
Turkish Angora cats are one of a few breeds that enjoy water. These cats have a fondness for faucets, and given the opportunity, will happily accompany their people into the shower or sit on the side of the bathtub, perhaps dipping a paw to create mesmerizing ripples. Some individuals have even been known to swim!
Although the Turkish Angora cat enjoys attention, members of this breed are a bit less demanding than their Siamese and Oriental cousins. So long as these kitties have plenty of toys to keep them entertained throughout the day, they're fine with spending time on their own and will greet you with great enthusiasm when you return from a long day at work."
